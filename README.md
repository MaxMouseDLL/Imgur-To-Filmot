#Imgur to Filmot (Firefox Addon)
This is just a simple Firefox addon that changes all imgur links to filmot links. It is useful in scenarios where your school/college/office firewall has blocked the imgur website. Made specially for reddit fans but should work on all websites.

Can be found at Firefox Add-on gallery at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-Us/firefox/addon/imgur-to-filmot/
